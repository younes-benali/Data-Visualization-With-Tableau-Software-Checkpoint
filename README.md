# 🌍 Global Earthquake Analysis (2001–2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a worldwide earthquakes dataset using **Tableau Public**.  
The objective is to explore earthquake patterns, magnitude distribution, tsunami occurrence, and geographic trends through interactive visualizations and a dashboard.

The dataset contains earthquake records from **January 1, 2001 to January 1, 2023**, collected from Kaggle.

## 📊 Visualizations & Analysis

### 1️⃣ Earthquakes Resulting in a Tsunami
- **Visualization:** Pie Chart  
- **Purpose:** Shows the proportion of earthquakes that resulted in a tsunami versus those that did not.  
- **Insight:** Only a small fraction of earthquakes trigger tsunamis, highlighting their relative rarity.

---

### 2️⃣ Worldwide Magnitude Distribution
- **Visualization:** Symbol Map  
- **Purpose:** Displays the global distribution of earthquake magnitudes.  
- **Encoding:**  
  - Circle size → Magnitude  
  - Color intensity → Magnitude  
- **Insight:** Strong earthquakes are concentrated along tectonic plate boundaries, particularly around the Pacific Ring of Fire.

---

### 3️⃣ Magnitude Fluctuation in Peru and Russia
- **Visualization:** Line Chart  
- **Purpose:** Compares how earthquake magnitudes fluctuate over time in Peru and Russia.  
- **Insight:** Both countries show temporal variation in earthquake strength, with noticeable peaks corresponding to major seismic events.

---

### 4️⃣ Relationship Between Magnitude and Significance
- **Visualization:** Scatter Plot  
- **Purpose:** Examines the relationship between earthquake magnitude and significance level.  
- **Insight:** A positive correlation is observed—higher magnitude earthquakes generally have higher significance, although variability exists due to other influencing factors such as depth and population exposure.

---

### 5️⃣ Magnitude Distribution in 2022
- **Visualization:** Histogram  
- **Purpose:** Shows how earthquake magnitudes were distributed during the year 2022.  
- **Insight:** Most earthquakes fall within moderate magnitude ranges, while high-magnitude events are less frequent.

---

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard includes the following KPIs:

- **Total Earthquakes**
- **Average Magnitude**
- **Maximum Magnitude**
- **Tsunami Rate (%)**
- **Number of Countries Impacted**

These indicators provide a high-level summary of global seismic activity.

---

## 🧩 Dashboard Design
All visualizations and KPIs are integrated into a single interactive dashboard, allowing users to:
- Explore earthquake patterns worldwide
- Compare trends between countries
- Understand the impact and significance of seismic events

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau Public (Desktop)**
- **CSV Dataset from Kaggle**

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization can be used to analyze and communicate complex seismic data effectively.  
The dashboard provides insights into earthquake behavior, geographic distribution, tsunami occurrence, and magnitude trends across time and regions.
